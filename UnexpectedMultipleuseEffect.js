This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an empty dependency array (`[]`).  While seemingly harmless, it can lead to unexpected behavior if you intend for the effect to run only once on mount.  The problem arises when the component renders multiple times during mount due to optimization passes by React, causing the effect to run multiple times instead of just once.
